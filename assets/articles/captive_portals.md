#How captive portals work

A captive portal is what we call a network that requires your action before it allows you to connect to the Internet. This action could be to log in using a username and password, or just to accept the network's terms and conditions.

The way most networks do this is by redirecting you to such a page. Firefox will make automatic connections to detect these redirects. When those happen, you will see a notification indicating that you may need to log into the network. Normally, after you do this, the tab will be closed automatically. Occasionally, it will be kept around to display a message from the network's owners.
